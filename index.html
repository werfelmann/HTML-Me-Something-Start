            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Hi, I'm David, and this is a travel log of my experience hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in 2021.</p>

            <h3>Preparing to Hike</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_2841.jpeg" alt="starting gear">
            <p>Preparing for the hike was a process that took months&mdash;no&mdash;years. Getting the time off from work, acquiring all the gear, and getting as much information as I could about what to expect on the trail was a journey of its own.</p>

            <h3>600 Miles Through the Desert</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_2933.jpeg" alt="Desert Landscape">
            <p>The trail begins at the southern border of the United States at Campo, CA. The first 600 miles winds its way through gorgeous deserts. Cacti, lizards, and rattle snakes are common sightings in this portion. Water is relatively scarce here too&mdash;I am so grateful for the many "Trail Angels" who maintain water caches throughout this portion of the trail.</p>

            <h3>The Sierra Nevada</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_4501 2.jpeg" alt="A Beautiful Lake in the Sierra Nevada">
            <p>The Sierra Nevada made for some of the most epic hiking and jaw-dropping vistas. At this point of the trail, I had my "hiking legs" and could do some serious miles every day. This section had plenty of water, but was challenging for its many, many passes. The highest point of the trail can be found in this section at Forester Pass. But I went even higher, summiting Mount Whitney late at night so that I could watch the sunrise from the top.</p>

            <h3>Northern California</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_5391.jpeg" alt="Sleeping Under the Stars in Northern California">
            <p>Between the Sierra Mountain Range and the Oregon border lies the Northern California section of the trail. By now, I am an expert hiker and can do 30+ miles in a day without breaking a sweat (OK, I sweat quite a lot, but you get the idea). It was in this section that I got the first of many experiences with wildfires, which would be a constant companion for the rest of the trail. I have many good memories of sleeping under the stars in Northern California.</p>

            <h3>Oregon:<br>A Homecoming</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_5953.jpeg" alt="Oregon Forest">
            <p>As a native Oregonian, hiking through Oregon felt like coming home. The trail gets noticably more gentle in this section, and the views are not nearly as incredible as they were in California (or in Washington ahead), but hiking through wooded hills and swimming in mountain lakes still made for a wonderful hike.</p>

            <h3>Washington:<br>The Final Stretch</h3>
            <img src="/images/IMG_6397.jpeg" alt="Knife's Edge in Washington">
            <p>Washington was incredible. With the end in sight, I decided to go it alone for this stretch, challening myself to hike long miles and test my resilience and independence. Washington had some of the most beautiful views of the entire trail, rivaling the splendor of the Sierra. What made Washington special was how rugged it was. I loved this portion of the trail, even though it was bittersweet to near the end of an incredible journey.</p>
